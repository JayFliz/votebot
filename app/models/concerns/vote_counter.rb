<!-- votebot instructions -->
This proposal is open for discussion and voting. If you are a [contributor](https://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/users/) to this repository (and not the proposer), you may vote on whether or not it is accepted. 

## How to vote
Vote by entering one of the following symbols in a comment on this pull request. Only your last vote will be counted, and you may change your vote at any time until the change is accepted or closed.

|vote|symbol|type this|points|
|--|--|--|--|
|Agree|:thumbsup:|`:thumbsup:`|#{ENV["UPVOTE_WEIGHT"]}|
|Abstain|:hand:|`:hand:`|#{ENV["ABSTAIN_WEIGHT"]}|
|Block|:thumbsdown:|`:thumbsdown:`|#{ENV["DOWNVOTE_WEIGHT"]}|

Proposals will be accepted and merged once they have a total of #{ENV["PASS_THRESHOLD"]} points when all votes are counted. Votes will be open for a minimum of #{ENV["MIN_AGE"]} days, but will be closed if the proposal is not accepted after #{ENV["MAX_AGE"]}.

Votes are counted [automatically here](https://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/proposals/#{number}), and results are set in the merge status checks below.

## Changes

If the proposer makes a change to the proposal, no votes cast before that change will be counted.
